* Qualcomm MSM HSUART

Required properties:
- compatible : one of:
	- "qcom,msm-lsuart-v14"
- reg : offset and length of the register set for the device.
- interrupts : should contain the uart interrupt.

Aliases:
An alias may optionally be used to bind the serial device to a tty device
(ttyHSLx) with a given line number. Aliases are of the form serial<n> where <n>
is an integer representing the line number to use. On systems with multiple
serial devices present it is recommended that an alias be defined for each such
device.

Example:
	aliases {
		serial0 = &uart0;       // This device will be called ttyHSL0
	};

	uart0: serial@19c400000 {
		compatible = "qcom,msm-lsuart-v14"
		reg = <0x19c40000 0x1000">;
		interrupts = <195>;
	};
