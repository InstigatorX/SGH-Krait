* Qualcomm MSM HSUART

Required properties:
- compatible : one of:
	- "qcom,msm-lsuart-v14"
- reg : offset and length of the register set for the device.
- interrupts : should contain the uart interrupt.

Optional properties:
- qcom,config-gpio : Set this value if UART GPIOs need to be configured by driver.
set 4 if 4-wire UART used (for Tx, Rx, CTS, RFR GPIOs).
Set 1 if 2-wire UART used (for Tx, Rx GPIOs).
- qcom,<gpio-name>-gpio : handle to the GPIO node, see "gpios property" in
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/gpio/gpio.txt.
"gpio-name" can be "tx", "rx", "cts" and "rfr" based on number of UART GPIOs
need to configured.

Aliases:
An alias may optionally be used to bind the serial device to a tty device
(ttyHSLx) with a given line number. Aliases are of the form serial<n> where <n>
is an integer representing the line number to use. On systems with multiple
serial devices present it is recommended that an alias be defined for each such
device.

Example:
	aliases {
		serial0 = &uart0;       // This device will be called ttyHSL0
	};

	uart0: serial@19c400000 {
		compatible = "qcom,msm-lsuart-v14"
		reg = <0x19c40000 0x1000">;
		interrupts = <195>;

		qcom,config-gpio = <4>;
		qcom,tx-gpio = <&msmgpio 41 0x00>;
		qcom,rx-gpio = <&msmgpio 42 0x00>;
		qcom,cts-gpio = <&msmgpio 43 0x00>;
		qcom,rfr-gpio = <&msmgpio 44 0x00>;
	};
